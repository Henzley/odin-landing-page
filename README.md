# odin-landing-page

Landing page project for the foundations section of the odin project

Honestly just finished this project as soon as I could. So commits are very, very scarce.
It was fun though.
Did'nt Google as much as I thought I would. But I also don't think that I followed best practices.

I'll definitely want to come back to this project in the future and make it more neat and customize it to my liking.
